# Description
This course is free of cost. Take advantage of this course and enhance your skills in GUI Python programming!!!

Most of us write code and run it in a command-line terminal or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The code produces an output based on what you expect out of it, either on the terminal or on the IDE itself. 

However, if we want our system to have a fancy looking user-interface, our application (use-case) requires having a GUI. 

GUI is nothing but a desktop app that provides us with an interface which helps us to interact with the computers and enriches our experience of giving a command (command-line input) to our code. 

Some of the applications like Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Text-Editors, Sudoku, etc. utilize the power of GUIs
